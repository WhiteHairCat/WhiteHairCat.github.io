I am currently a second-year PhD student at Carleton University, supervised by [Dr. Ahmed El-Roby](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~ahmedelroby/) and [Dr. Diana Inkpen](http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~diana/). Previously, I received my M.Sc. degree from Lanzhou University in 2018 under Dr. Lian Li. 
I actively work as a researcher in the field of Deep Learning, more details [here](https://whitehaircat.github.io//teaching/).
