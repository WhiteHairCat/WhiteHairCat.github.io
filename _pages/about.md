I am currently a second-year PhD student at Carleton University, supervised by [Dr. Ahmed El-Roby](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~ahmedelroby/) and [Dr. Diana Inkpen](http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~diana/). Previously, I received my M.Sc. degree from Lanzhou University in 2018 under Dr. Lian Li. 
I actively work as a researcher in the field of Deep Learning, my primary research interests lie in Transfer Learning, especially domain adaptation and multi-task learning. Currently, my work focuses on applying adversarial training in trasnfer learning.
